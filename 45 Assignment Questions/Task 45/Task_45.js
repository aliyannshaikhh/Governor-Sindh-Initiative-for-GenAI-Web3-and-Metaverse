//Task No. 45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function car(modelName, manufacturerName, modelYear, color) {
    var car_info = {
        modelName: modelName,
        manufacturerName: manufacturerName,
        modelYear: modelYear,
        color: color
    };
    return car_info;
}
var car1 = car("NAM78", "BMW", 2018, "Silver");
var car2 = car("UI908", "Toyota", 2019, "Black");
var car3 = car("78HUI", "Honda", 2018, "Cherry");
console.log(car1);
console.log(car2);
console.log(car3);
